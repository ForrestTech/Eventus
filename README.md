## Synopsis

Eventus is a framework that provides a common setup for working with [Event Soured](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html) data.  It provides an abstractions over different storage providers.  Some common storage providers are implemented.  This libarary is inspired [NEventStore](https://github.com/NEventStore/NEventStore) and other frameworks,  they are all great but did not work exactly as I wasnted them to. 

## Install

The easiest way to install eventus is our [nuget](http://www.nuget.org) package.  There are also storage provider specific nuget [packages](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=eventus). 

**Core Eventus Library**

```
> Install-Package Eventus
```

**Example Storage Provider**

```
> Install-Package Eventus.EventStore
```

## Event Sourcing 

Event soucing is a large topic and an understanding of it is needed to effectively use Eventus.  This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHGkaShoyNs) by Greg young is a good starting place.

## Example Usage 

Example using Eventstore storage provider.  


```csharp
var connection = EventStoreConnection.Create(new IPEndPoint(IPAddress.Loopback, 1113);
var snapshotFrequency = 5;
var repository = new Repository(new EventstoreStorageProvider(connection),
                                new EventstoreSnapshotStorageProvider(connection, snapshotFrequency));

var accountId = Guid.NewGuid();
var bankAccount = new BankAccount(accountId, "John Doe");
bankAccount.Deposit(100);
bankAccount.Withdrawal(50);
bankAccount.Deposit(5);
bankAccount.Withdrawal(15);

await repository.SaveAsync(bankAccount);

var fromStore = repository.GetByIdAsync(accountId);

```

All aggregates must inherit from the `Aggregate` base class.  Your aggreagate classes should encapsulate their state and only allow change through specific methods.  In Eventus state change is then encapsulated into an `Event` object which is applied to the aggregate.

```csharp
public class BankAccount : Aggregate
{
     public void Deposit(decimal amount, Guid correlationId = new Guid())
     {
        var deposit = new FundsDepositedEvent(Id, CurrentVersion, correlationId, amount);
        ApplyEvent(deposit);
     }
}
```

Events must implement the `IEvent` interface.  The state of the aggregate is change in apply event methods.  By default in Eventus these are private methods on the aggregate that accept the event as a single parameter.  This behavior can be changed by overriding the ApplyEvent method.  

```csharp
public class BankAccount : Aggregate
{
    private void OnFundsDeposited(FundsDepositedEvent @event)
    {
        CurrentBalance = CurrentBalance + @event.Amount;
        var newTransaction = new Transaction(TransactionType.Deposit, @event.AggregateId, @event.Amount);
        Transactions.Add(newTransaction);
    }
}
```

This allows events to be saved for storage in the provider being used and it also allows historic events to be loaded from storage and applied to the aggregate. 

## Samples

There is a [sample application](https://github.com/feanz/Eventus/tree/master/src/Eventus.Samples.Console) that has example aggregates, commands and events.
